  <h2 id="getting_code">Getting the Code</h2>

  <p>To get the template code for this project, see your course page for the GitHub Classroom assignment link.</p>

  <p>Once you have accepted the assignment, which will create a GitHub repository for your project code, you will need to get the code onto the robot. You will be cloning the repository <em>on the robot's Raspberry Pi</em>.
    See the <a href="/mbot/programming">robot tutorial</a> for instructions on how to open a remote VSCode session connected to the robot. Once you are connected to the robot, in VSCode, open a terminal. This should be a terminal in the robot's Raspberry Pi. Then, clone the repository in the home directory:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">git clone &lt;ADDRESS&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>Substitute <strong>&ltADDRESS&gt</strong> with the Git address for your repository found on GitHub. Open the folder of the repository you just cloned in VSCode using the instructions in the <a href="/mbot/programming">tutorial</a>.</p>

  <p>You should always sign the license for your code by editing the file <code>LICENSE.txt</code>. Replace <code>&lt;COPYRIGHT HOLDER&gt;</code> with the names of all teammates, separated by commas. Replace <code>&lt;YEAR&gt;</code> with the current year.</p>

  <ul class="todo">

  </header>

    <p>
      In this project, we will implement an autonomous navigation algorithm. The lectures in <a href="/modules/module2">Module 2</a> describe an algorithm called the Bug Algorithm. You can implement this algorithm as describe in this lecture, or implement an algorithm of your own. An example of the bug navigation algorithm in action can be found below.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
      You should use the robot's odometry to get the position. You may reuse your wall follower algorithm from <a href="/projects/p1">Project 1</a>. To program the robot, we will use the <a href="/mbot/bridge-api">MBot Bridge API</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="robot_hits_the_spot">Robot Hits the Spot</h3>

    <p>
      The first step is to navigate to a given goal position and angle.
      In <a href="/projects/p1#sec_square">Project 1.1</a>, we wrote a program that drove in a square by sending velocity commands to the robot.
      The square was not very accurate because we had no way of checking whether the robot had acheived the desired position.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, we will use the robot's <emph>odometry</emph> to ensure that the robot navigates to the desired goal.
      You should compare the robot's current pose with the goal pose to compute the velocity command for the robot.
      Your program should stop when the robot has reached the goal.
    </p>

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1">P2.1 Robot Hits the Spot:</strong>
        Write an algorithm that drives the robot to a desired goal pose.
        You should implement this algorithm in the function
        <span class="cpp-content"><code>driveToPose()</code> in the file <code>hit_the_spot.cpp</code></span>
        <span class="python-content"><code>drive_to_pose()</code> in the file <code>hit_the_spot.py</code></span>.
        To get full points for this task, you should demo your robot driving to a series of goals given by course staff.
        Print the robot's pose after each goal has been reached.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="bug">Bug Navigation</h3>

    <p>
      Once we can drive to a goal location, we must encorporate avoiding obstacles. You should develop an algorithm using a State Machine (see <a href="/modules/module2">Module 2</a>).
      <!-- We will implement the Bug 0 Algorithm as a State Machine which has three states: drive towards the goal, wall follow around obstacles, and reached goal.
      The algorithm continues until the goal is reached, doing the following at each iteration: -->
    </p>

    <!-- <ol>
      <li>Check whether the robot has reached the goal, or whether it should be in the drive to goal state or the wall following state.</li>
      <li>If the robot has reached the goal, terminate the program.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, compute the velocity command which drives towards the goal <i>OR</i> follows the obstacle, depending on the state.</li>
      <li>Send the command to the robot.</li>
    </ol> -->

    <p>
      Your algorithm should start by determining which state to be in. For example, if the path to the goal is obstructed, the robot should avoid the obstacle.
    </p>

    <ul class="todo">

      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo2">P2.2:</strong>
        Write out your autonomous navigation algorithm and submit it to course staff. Consider using pseudocode and state machine diagrams to describe in detail how the algorithm will work.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- <p>
      Use the function <code>findMinRayInSlice()</code> to determine which state the robot is in.
      Print out the state of the robot at each iteration of the algorithm.
    </p> -->

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo3">P2.3:</strong>
        Write code to determine the state of the robot at each iteration and print the current state to the screen.
        Course staff should be able to read the output to ensure your bug navigation is correctly transitioning between states.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        You can keep track of the state of the robot using an integer, like we did in class.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="cpp-content">

    <p>In Project 1, we wrote a function to find the minimum ray in the Lidar scan.
      This time, we want to know if there is an obstacle along the path to the goal.
      The template code includes a function <code>findMinRayInSlice()</code> which will tell us the minimum ray in a specific slice of the Lidar scan. You may use this function to determine whether there is an obstacle in the direction of the goal.</p>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        We have provided the function <code>findMinRayInSlice()</code> which finds the index of the minimum ray in a slice of the Lidar scan.
        The slice is centered around <code>target_angle</code>, passed as input to the function.
        The slice encompasses rays within <code>slice_size</code> radians of <code>target_angle</code>. You can use this function to determine if there is an obstacle in the path to the goal.
      </li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <p>
      You should now have the tools to complete your bug navigation.
      Write your algorithm in the file <span class="cpp-content"><code>bug_navigation.cpp</code></span><span class="python-content"><code>bug_navigation.py</code></span>.
      The code should ask the user for <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>theta</code> values for the goal, and drive to the given pose.

        In the file <span class="cpp-content"><code>bug_navigation.cpp</code></span><span class="python-content"><code>bug_navigation.py</code></span>, write a program that drives to a goal location and avoids obstacles following the procedure outlined above.
        For full points, your robot will need to drive to a goal given by course staff.
        Staff will test 2-3 runs of your bug navigation.

  <div class="cpp-content">
  <p>
    For Project 2, we will compile and run our code the same way as in <a href="/projects/p1">Project 1</a>.
    To build the code, in a terminal, type:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">cd ~/[my-bug-nav-dir]/build
cmake ..
make</code></pre>

  <p>
    Remember that the code should be cloned and compiled on the Raspberry Pi. This will fail on your computer!
    You should replace <code>[my-bug-navigation-dir]</code> with the name of your bug navigation directory.
    For a review of what these commands do, see <a href="/projects/p1#code">the Project 1 description</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Repository structure</h3>

  <p>The repository includes the following dirctories and files:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Provided functions</h3>

  <p>To use provided functions, all you need to do is include the correct header file. The needed header files should already be included in the templates. Also refer to the <a href="/mbot/bridge-api">MBot Bridge API</a> to learn how to control the robot and read its sensor data. The following functions are provided in this repo:</p>

  <ul class="hint">

      <code>void sleepFor(float secs)</code>: Sleep for a given number of seconds.
    </li>
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
      <code>float wrapAngle(float angle)</code>: Wrap an angle in the range [-pi, pi]. This function returns the wrapped angle.
    </li>
